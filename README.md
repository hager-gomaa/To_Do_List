# To-Do List Application (Python)

This is a simple command-line To-Do List application developed using Python.
The project was created during my first year at university as a practice
to understand basic programming concepts.

## Project Description
The application allows users to manage a list of tasks through a text-based menu.
Users can add tasks, view all tasks, remove tasks, or exit the program.

## Features
- Add new tasks to the list
- View all existing tasks
- Remove tasks by their number
- User-friendly command-line menu
- Input validation for better user experience

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook / Python Script

## How It Works
1. The program displays a menu with available options
2. The user selects an option by entering a number (1–4)
3. Tasks are stored in a list during runtime
4. The program continues running until the user chooses to quit

## How to Run
1. Open the `.ipynb` file using Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab  
   **OR**
2. Copy the code into a `.py` file and run it using:
   ```bash
   python todo_list.py
